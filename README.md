I'm a 19-year-old Video Game Journalist from Islamabad, Pakistan, currently working part-time for VeryAli Gaming and Gamesual. Previously, I'd been working full-time as the Online News Editor for eXputer for almost six months, between March 2022 and August 2022 and part-time as a Content Writer for TheNerdMag for almost three months, between May 2020 and July 2020. Recently, I've worked as a Video Game Journalist on contract for VeryAli Gaming and TopTierList. I'm also a freelance Content Writer and Copywriter working part-time on Fiverr.

I completed my high-school education from Army Public School & College Ordnance Road, Rawalpindi, in June 2021 and, as of September 2021, am currently enrolled in the Bachelor's of Sciences in Data Science — BS(DS) — programme at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad (FAST-NUCES).
